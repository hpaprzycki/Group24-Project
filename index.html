  <h3 class= "text-center text-uppercase text-secondary">Day One - A Walk Through Hisory </h3>
  <p class= "container text-justify"> Today is going to be about taking in the city’s rich history. While walking along some of the cobblestone streets of Philadelphia, take a moment to let it sink in that you are literally walking on history. This is the city where our country was born. How America’s government was going to be run  was decided in this city. In fact, they were decided inside some of the various buildings we are going to be visiting today. </p>
  <h5 class= "container text-secondary"> Stop One - Independence Hall </h5>
    <p class= "container text-justify"> The <strong class="text-secondary">Independence Hall</strong>, which is where The Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution were created and signed (Independence National Historical Park 2018). Note that the bell located at the top of the tower is not the original Liberty Bell but that is how the original one looked during our founding fathers delegations.</p>

</figure>
  <h5 class= "container text-secondary"> Liberty Bell </h5>
    <p class= "container text-justify"> The actual <strong class="text-secondary">Liberty Bell</strong> is located in a display nearby, which continues to be a symbol of our country’s liberty. See the iconic crack up close, and remember that great leaders of America’s past have gained inspiration from the inscriptions on the bell. </p>

</figure>
  <h5 class= "container text-secondary"> The Benjamin Franklin Museum </h5>
    <p class="container text-justify"> Next, check out the <strong class= "text-secondary">Benjamin Franklin Museum</strong>. A building to honor one of the world’s most famous inventors. Inside of the museum you learn about Ben Franklin’s character and life. As well as his passion and discoveries in science and religion. His position on religious freedom is well-known and one of the reasons the United States of America does not have a national religion.</p>
  <h5 class="container text-secondary"> Historical Sites </h5>
    <p class="container text-justify"> Close by is <strong class= "text-secondary">The President's House</strong> - Where George Washington lived (along with the slaves he brought with him from Virginia). A block north of the President's House is the National Constitution Center. This institution was appointed by congress to “disseminate information about the United States Constitution on a nonpartisan basis in order to increase the awareness and understanding of the Constitution among the American people.” The center has many exhibits, and its entire goal is to teach you about the constitution and its interpretation in our government today (National Constitution Center 2018). Nearby is the <strong class= "text-secondary">City Hall</strong> who’s architecture dates back to the 1600s and was standing when the founding fathers signed the constitution. It is one of the biggest buildings in the US used for local government. </p>
  <h5 class= "container text-secondary"> Reading Terminal Market </h5>
    <p class= "container text-justify"> Lets get some lunch at <strong class= "text-secondary">Reading Terminal Market</strong>, which features food from around the world. If you’re on a mission to eat as many cheesesteaks as you can during your 48 hour tour, stop by Carmen’s to grab one on the cheap (Reading Terminal Market 2018). Fun fact: Barack Obama has visited this traditional sandwich shop! </p>
  <h5 class= "container text-secondary"> Philadelphia Museum of Art </h5>
    <p class= "container text-justify"> Our next stop is the <strong class="text-secondary">Philadelphia Museum of Art</strong>, which is the third-largest museum in America, and one of its most famous (Philadelphia Museum of Art 2018). The stairs to the entrance are dubbed the “Rocky” stairs, and you will not be be the only one running up them trying to mimic Rocky Balboa in all his movies. There are many interesting exhibits here, so you are very likely to spend the rest of your afternoon looking through them all. </p>

  <h5 class="container text-secondary"> Philly Cheesesteaks</h5>
    <p class= "container text-justify"> Once you have built up an appetite, head towards one of the most famous cheesesteak shops in the city; <strong class= "text-secondary">Pat’s King of Steaks</strong> or <strong class= "text-secondary">Geno’s Steaks</strong> - Or both? Located right across the street from each other, there has been a long time rivalry between these two sandwich shops. Pat’s opened in 1930, and it is credited with creating the Philadelphia cheesesteak. Geno’s opened 36 years later, ad they claimed to have perfected the sandwich. You can decide for yourself if the best Philly cheesesteak is made with provolone cheese or Cheez Wiz. </p>
<br>
<br>
<h3 class= "text-center text-uppercase text-secondary"> Day Two - Keep On Exploring </h3>
<p class= "container text-justify"> Yesterday, you experienced a lot of the history Philadelphia had to offer. Today, you are going to experience the current culture of the city. Philly wasn’t just unique in the past, it’s alive and thriving now. </p>
<h5 class= "container text-secondary"> La Colombe </h5>
<p class= "container text-justify"> We’re going to start out the day by grabbing a coffee and pastry at local coffee shop <strong class="text-secondary">La Colombe</strong>. The shop distills its own coffee-infused rum! La Colombe coffee has been roasted in Philly for decades (La Colombe Coffee Roasters 2018). There are many different coffee options to try here, and you’ll feel like a classic hipster in the brick-chic atmosphere. </p>

<h5 class= "container text-secondary"> Mural Mile </h5>
<p class= "container text-justify"> Next, you’re going to catch a tour of <strong class= "text-secondary">Mural Mile</strong>. This is a neat tour that last about two hours and takes you through the various murals around the city. Philadelphia has a mural arts program that was created in 1984 to help aid against graffiti, the program invites graffiti offenders to join artists in creating murals (Mural Arts Tours 2018). </p>
<h5 class= "container text-secondary"> Lunch Plans </h5>
<p class= "container text-justify">For lunch, let's head over to <strong class= "text-secondary">Spruce Street Harbor Park</strong>. This local hangout offers great views of the Delaware river. You’ll see lots of natives relaxing on Hammocks throughout the area (Visit Spruce Stree Harbor Park in Philadelphia 3018). The park houses a lot of food trucks, which are great for a quick and authentic lunch. Make sure to check out <strong class="text-secondary">Federal Donuts</strong>, they feature a lot of unique and Instagram-worthy treats! </p>
<h5 class= "container text-secondary"> Fairmount Park </h5>
<p class= "container text-justify"> After eating, start working your way towards another famous spot, <strong class= "text-secondary">Fairmount Park</strong>. This park is 11 times bigger than Central Park in New York City, and it is home to the <strong class="text-secondary">Philadelphia Zoo</strong>(farimount Park Conservancy 2018). Spend a little time wandering around the Zoo, and basking in the fact that a huge urban city also hosts lions and zebras.</p>
<h5 class="container text-secondary"> Philadelphia's Magic Gardens </h5>
<p class= "container text-justify"> Once you’ve had your fun with the animals, work your way over to the <strong class="text-secondary">Philadelphia’s Magic Gardens</strong>. This is an ongoing city art project. The outdoor museum is run by a non-profit organization and spans half a block (Philadelphia Magic Gardens Home 2018). You’ll find this art museum is very unique and different than the pieces you saw yesterday, many featuring colored glass and objects like bicycles. </p>

<h5 class= "container text-secondary"> South 9th street Curb Market </h5>
<p class= "container text-justify"> Not too far away is the <strong class="text-secondary">South 9th Street Curb Market</strong>, commonly referred to as <strong class=text-secondary>The Italian Market</strong>(South 9th Street Italian Market 2018). Between all the local shops, restaurants, and bakeries in the market, you’ll have quite the struggle trying to decide what's for dinner!</p>
